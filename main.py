"""This is a multi file example showcasing many features of the command extension and the use of cogs.
These are examples only and are not intended to be used as a fully functioning bot. Rather they should give you a basic
understanding and platform for creating your own bot.
These examples make use of Python 3.6.2 and the rewrite version on the lib.
For examples on cogs for the async version:
